      <h1>When 500 Computers Go Missing: Lessons from a Major Hotel Opening</h1>

      <p>
        I recently had the opportunity to join the pre-opening team for a major
        hotel opening (1500+ rooms!). That's one of the things I enjoy a great
        deal about being an IT manager for a global organization â€” although I
        work regionally, I am occasionally called upon to assist on task forces.
      </p>

      <h2>How Hotels Order Computers (Spoiler: It's Messy)</h2>

      <p>
        I worked on the computer inventory project, which sounds easy but is
        not. You'd think there would be a better way to order computers for a
        hotel, but it seems to consistently be a mess. Here's how the process
        works: each computer is tied to a job title that the hotel has received
        approval to hire, either now or in the future. Once the hotel leadership
        has the list of job titles, they sit down with the IT opening team.
        Together, the group decides for each job title whether they should
        receive a laptop, desktop, or no computer. Laptops (plus a monitor and
        dock) tend to be more expensive, so they are generally reserved for
        positions with more seniority. This means one must be careful when
        distributing equipment â€” if you give the assistant manager of
        housekeeping a laptop and tell the director of food and beverage,
        "Sorry! Can I give you a desktop instead?", they tend to be unhappy (and
        less productive, which is the real kicker.)
      </p>

      <p>
        So, anyhow, the leadership team and IT team decide on which devices
        should be ordered and then they start ordering devices. One of the first
        complications of this process is that there is not one big order where a
        pallet with two tons of computers shows up at your newly-built hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operational work starts well before the hotel itself is ready for its
        staff to move in. You'll have a pre-opening office located near the
        hotel, and the team that is working at that office needs laptops and
        printers and other equipment to work. So, you'll do a smaller order or
        handful of orders to get the team initially up and running. Then you
        hire and hire and hire and all of a sudden you have directors and senior
        managers and you need more devices. So, you keep putting in orders and
        then at some point you just do the big push of submitting all of the
        remaining devices.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Approached the Inventory Crisis</h2>

      <p>
        By the time I arrived on site for the opening, the team had moved from
        the pre-opening office to the hotel itself. Plus, they'd been busy â€”
        about half of the 500 or so computers and laptops had already been
        distributed around the property. The other half were sitting in the
        conference room our team had taken over and filled with provisions from
        Costco (our war room, as we affectionately called it). Still, all this
        work had happened, and there was no complete inventory of where each
        device was located and where the remaining devices needed to be
        deployed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a real business problem. As an IT leader, the last thing you
        want to be asking yourself (two weeks before opening) is "have we
        ordered enough computers? Do we need to order more?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Or, even worse, "Did we accidentally give someone a computer that was
        not earmarked for them?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus, inventories are just helpful for day to day work. You are miles
        ahead when preparing for capital expenditures when you know exactly when
        each device was purchased and when it is no longer covered by the
        manufacturer's support. You are able to troubleshoot faster and more
        effectively when you know what is where.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I arrived, four other people (including the hotel's director of
        technology) had attempted to build an inventory. There was no document
        that was iterated to create an up-to-date inventory â€” only a few
        snapshots from moments in time that recorded some (maybe 20%?) of the
        devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The IT project manager actually barked at me to not "waste my time
        building an inventory" and told me that building an inventory this late
        in the game was "impossible." In fact, she was so against the idea of
        the pre-opening team working on inventory that she refused to share the
        order sheet with anyone, including me. So, I had to be creative.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have internal systems that I can use to see which devices are
        connected to the network. By looking across a few of them, I had a
        pretty good idea of how many devices had been physically set up on
        property. I knew this late in the game there would be no more devices
        shipped, so everything that was online now (either in its actual
        location or sitting in our conference room) was everything that we had.
        With that, I had a list of all of the devices and their serial numbers.
        I just then needed to find every computer â€” how hard could that be?
      </p>

          Use the tools you have creatively. When I couldn't get access to the
          order sheet, I worked backwards from network data to build my own
          starting point. There's almost always another way to approach a
          problem.

      </p>

      <p>
        I started by just going around the hotel, and everywhere I could find a
        computer, I recorded the serial number of the device and its location.
        Within a few hours, I had identified about 80% of the devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the day, when the project manager saw how much progress I
        had made, she gave me kudos and said, "huh. Maybe you actually can solve
        this problem." And so I became one of the select few who had access to
        the order sheet.

          Sometimes, you have to prove the "impossible" is possible. When
          stakeholders are burned out from previous failed attempts, they'll
          resist new efforts. I had to demonstrate progress before getting
          buy-in, not the other way around.

      </p>

      <p>
        With this information, I had more context to track down the remaining
        missing computers (who knew that hotels have harbormasters now? Or that
        they need computers?!).
      </p>

      <p>
        With the order sheet, I was able to correlate deployed computers with
        the job titles those computers were ordered for, based on the physical
        location they were in. Even if you don't know (or don't care) which
        device was deployed to which of the twenty accountants, you can feel
        confident inventorying the twenty computers in the accounting office and
        marking those computers as deployed. Within another day, I had created a
        list, organized by department, showing how many computers had been
        deployed and how many needed to be deployed still (from the conference
        room computer storage). Luckily for me, there were no over-deployments
        (people who received computers despite one not being ordered for them).
        In fact, there was kind of the opposite problem â€” leftover (spare!!!)
        computers.

          Focus on business impact, not perfect data. I didn't need to know
          exactly which accountant had which computer - I needed to know that
          accounting was properly equipped. Sometimes "good enough" data now
          that answers business questions is better than perfect data that comes
          too late.

        Having some spare computers isn't a terrible thing. It helps you respond
        to issues promptly. If a computer dies catastrophically somehow, you can
        simply warranty the dead device and replace it immediately with a spare.
        Still, you don't want to spend too much money proactively and then have
        devices you never use sitting around. A general rule for spares is 3â€“5%
        gives you a good balance to replace equipment quickly but not have
        wasted capital.
      </p>

      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>

      <p>
        Looking back, what started as a "waste of time" became one of the most
        valuable contributions I made to that opening. It reinforced my belief
        that sometimes the most important work happens in the unglamorous
        details that everyone else wants to skip.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, in your projects, document everything as you go. The reason
        this became such a mess in the first place was that no one maintained a
        living inventory document. Someone needs to either own the process from
        the very beginning or handoffs must ensure all relevant information is
        passed between parties appropriately. Every handoff between teams in
        this opening created information loss.
