      <h1>The surefire way to get into rock-climbing</h1>

      <p>
        I attended a small liberal arts college that had a small student body of
        around 3,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'd wanted to take rock climbing since my first year, but only the first
        15 lucky people who refreshed their computers and clicked a button fast
        enough got to spend a whole semester rock climbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a CS nerd, I wondered if there was a way I could click that button
        faster and more times such that I could guarantee that I would get to
        rock climb.
      </p>
      <img src="img/descend.JPG" alt="a man descending down a rock wall face" />
      <p>And indeed, I could!</p>
      <p>
        <em>wonderstruck.py</em> is a simple, command line based interface that
        builds a course catalog from my college’s student information system
        (SIS), allows a user to select classes and send many add requests to the
        SIS server.
      </p>
      <h2>Building the course catalog in Python</h2>
      <p>
        My college is nice enough to host a public endpoint for all of the
        classes, which lists interesting information such as course and
        instructor names, location, gen eds, and of course, number of remaining
        seats:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="img/sis.png" alt="a screenshot of a computer server" />
        <figcaption>
          Snippet from
          <a href="https://sis.stolaf.edu/sis/public-aclasslab.cfm#theresults"
            >SIS</a
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The first step of this tool downloads a local copy of the information on
        the SIS server and parses it into a format that we can interrogate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made a class (a Python class, not a class that I want to register for)
        that holds all the courses, the department list, and cookies, which are
        necessary to submit requests on behalf of a particular user. It also
        includes some headers, which are used for crafting HTTP requests to the
        server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first real function here is parse_classes, which downloads all the
        class information from SIS. Looking back on this is kind of heinous — I
        didn’t use a library like beautifulsoup to simplify parsing the HTML. I
        just looked the requests until I found markers of a course (for example,
        “td class=”sis-left etc etc”.
      </p>
      <pre><code>def parse_classes(self):
        print("building course list.")
        raw_class_list = r.get(search_url, headers=self.h, cookies=self.cj).text
        lines = raw_class_list.splitlines()
        for i in range(len(lines)):
            if 'td class="sis-left sis-deptnum" valign="top">' in lines[i]:
                dep_num_line = lines[i]
                dep = (dep_num_line.split(">")[1]).split("&")[0]
                num = (dep_num_line.split(";")[1]).split("<")[0]

                sec_line = lines[i+1]
                sec = (sec_line.split(">")[1]).split("<")[0]
                if sec == "":
                    sec = "0"
                
                id_name_line = lines[i+8]
                c_id = (id_name_line.split("clbid=")[1]).split('"')[0]
                name = (id_name_line.split('">')[1]).split("<")[0]

                # search variable line distance to find capacity
                # bug: lab classes are weird.
                capacity = ""
                for k in range(25,40):
                    if '<td class="sis-center" valign="top" style="white-space: nowrap;">' in lines[i+k]:
                        capacity = (lines[i+k+2].split(">")[1]).split("<")[0]

                new_course = Course(dep, num, sec, c_id, name, capacity)
                self.course_list.append(new_course)
        print("found {} classes.".format(len(self.course_list)))

      <p>
        This is probably not the most efficient method and certainly not the
        prettiest to look at. But it works, and isn’t that what programming is
        all about?
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is, with all of that ugly searching behind us, building a
        course object is dead simple: store each course with the important
        variables and append it to the master list.
      </p>
      <h2>Choosing your courses</h2>
      <p>
        With a list of courses built, we now face the challenge of telling the
        program which courses we would like to send the server many add requests
        for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, you could hardcode the program to send 500 requests for KINES 106
        (rock climbing, of course), but then what was the point of building that
        whole database? This simple UI prints out the course list for the user
        and then allows them to enter a department, number, and section.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user does a good job, the course is added to the “classes to send
        request for list”. If the user does a bad job (and does not submit
        proper input), they are scolded.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is of course a Python 101-level interface, but the ultimate
        sophistication is simplicity.
      </p>
      <pre><code>  def choose_classes(self):
        print("\nUse dep_name class_num section (enter 0 if only 1 section) format
        Example: SOAN 121 0\nEnter q to stop\n")
        while True:
            usr = input("Enter the class you want: ").split()
            
            try:
                if usr[0].upper() == "Q":
                    break
                if usr[0].upper() == "ALL":
                    self.print_course_list()
                    continue
                
                dep = usr[0].upper()
                num = usr[1]
                sec = usr[2]
                if sec != "0":
                    sec = sec.upper()
            except:
                print("bad input. Example: SOAN 121 0\n")
                continue

            if dep not in self.dep_list:
                print("bad dept! avaliable dept codes: {}\n".format(self.dep_list))
                continue

            found = False
            for c in self.course_list:
                if c.dep == dep and c.num == num and c.sec == sec:
                    self.user_classes.append(c)
                    print("added {} to your schedule!".format(c.name))
                    found = True
            if not found:
                print("course not found. available {} classes:".format(dep))
                self.print_course_list(dep)
</code></pre>
      <h2>Sending add requests</h2>
      <p>Now the magic!</p>
      <p>
        It turns out the fancy green “add” button you see when registering
        online is just a simple POST request.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't know what a POST request is, I'd advise you to shut down
        Kali Linux, open the dev tools panel in Chrome, and just start click on
        some requests as you navigate through a few websites. You'll learn a lot
        about how websites communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sending POST requests (or any, really) is very easy in Python thanks to
        the requests moeule:
      </p>
      <pre><code>   def send_post_requests(self, times=1):
        for i in range(times):
            print("\nattempt #{}\n-----------------------".format(i+1))            
            for c in self.user_classes:
                print("sending ADD request for {}".format(c.name))
                response = r.post(url, headers=self.h, data=c.gen_add_data(), cookies=self.cj).text
                self.parse_response(response, c)</code></pre>
      <h2>Wrap up</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few other bits of my code that you can read yourself, on
        Github.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, this totally worked! I got into rock climbing and had a
        blast.
      </p>
      <h2>Future ideas</h2>
      <p>
        If I hadn't graduated, there are a few other things I might have added
        to this project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hold a cached version of courses so you don’t have to re-download the
          entire course schedule each time you run the program. But, you do have
          to check for open seats, so maybe this is silly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add thread-based parallelism, so requests can be sent without waiting
          for responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a web-based UI (but I'd probably need to get a little better at
          web development first, hm?)
        </li>
      </ul>
